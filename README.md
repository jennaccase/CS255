The DriverPass project was for the client called DriverPass. They wanted to build a system to better help students who were taking their driving exam. They wanted to be able to have online exams as well as scheduling for appointments. I think I did well on documenting the use cases of this project. I was able to plan out how the application should work and map out the use cases for it. If I were to revise part of the work it would be with the class diagram. I think I did better on the diagrams designed to explain smaller aspects of the project but needed some work on adding detail to the more detailed diagrams. I interpreted the user's needs by documenting all of their requirements from the interview. From there, I implemented what would be needed to accomplish these goals. It is important to consider the user's needs because they are the ones who will be using the system once finished. I approach deisgning software by taking it one piece at a time. I found it easier to take it apart into smaller sections and flesh out what i wanted that to look like before moving on to the next thing. I think also that planning out the use cases ahead of time helped as well because then it was easier to go in and detail the different aspects of the use cases.
